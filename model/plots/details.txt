4_class - LSTM for 4 initial 4 classes
6_class - LSTM for 6 classeses
exp1 - More simplfied version of original lstm  remove 1 bi-directional layer and two dense layers
exp1_step=2 - Impelemnted steps sizes for frames and set it to 2
exp1_step=3 - Impelemnted steps sizes for frames and set it to 3
exp1_step=4 - Impelemnted steps sizes for frames and set it to 4
exp4 - 3 Bidirectional layers and 4 Dense layers
